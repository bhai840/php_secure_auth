                       PHP Secure Authentication Package

Author: Jody Bruchon <jody@jodybruchon.com>

This project began because every example I found on the Internet for how to
do PHP authentication gave a lot of bad advice and was sorely out-of-date.
The goal is to create a simple PHP/MySQL user authentication system that
is actually secure while also being simple and easy to understand. The use
of PHP's built-in password hash generation tools and CSRF tokens greatly
improves the security beyond the tired old "MD5 hash it and stick it in the
database" tutorials all over the place. (MD5 is bad, kids, and CSRF is an
underappreciated way to ruin your day.)

Use the SQL code in setup_database.sql to set up the login and sessions
tables, then uncomment the command in letmein.php and execute it via the
browser to create a user account 'admin' with password 'password'. You
should immediately comment the command back out after doing so, or anyone
can run letmein.php to reset your admin password.

I can't guarantee this is actually secure. You need to review the code and
check for yourself. Don't blindly trust my code.

Please report bugs to me and I'll fix them as fast as I can. I hope this
code is helpful to you! If so, feel free to let me know. ;-)
